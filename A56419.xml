            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap>d by a General Unanimity▪
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52840:3"/> and Concurrency in their Complaints, they assum'd to themselves the Name of their <hi>Sexes Representatives,</hi> and took a Resolution to seek Redress in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary way. Having likewise agreed to carry on their Designs under the gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Mantuaes</hi> (for the word Cloak is now to be cast off) of Religion and Property.</p>
            <p>The Place that was debated on for this great Assembly, was the <hi>Blew-house</hi> in <hi>Enfeild-Chase;</hi> first, because it was by vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Fame reputed to be the place where the <hi>Gun-powder-Plot</hi> was fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty, and fearing to be troubled with their Capital Enemies the Fleas, if croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much together at such a Busie time as that, they at last concluded upon <hi>Merton-Abby,</hi> which they found to be a place where their Husbands Ancestors had fat in former times, and made seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws; which they resolv'd to repeal upon the same spot.</p>
            <p>The next thing taken into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, in what Robes they should sit, whether in Men's or Womens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, whether with Beards, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 'em.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52840:3"/>
            <p>Thereupon they agreed to sit in Mens habit, and for Quickness-sake, to make use of their Husbands Clothes. For it was but reason, they said, that they should wear the Breeches, that were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to assume the power. And as for Beards, it was alledged, That the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Custom of shaving close among Men, had sav'd them the trouble of that Debate. Then, as for <hi>Perriwiggs,</hi> the <hi>Mode</hi> had already so much befriended them, that was but putting on a Hat, and they were perfect Man, without contradiction, as good as ever Leg was laid over, from the very Crown of the Head to the very bottom of the Chin, where the chiefest difference between the Sexes lay publick to the World.</p>
            <p>Now when the time of the Sessions began to approach, and that it behoved them to repair to the General Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, these Women made an easie shift to steal from their Husbands, whom they left snoring, and fast bound in the chains of Sleep, over-burden'd with the Ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of the last Nights Compotation. But Heavens! How you would have blessed your selves? In what an Agony you would have been for fear of losing the Drums of your Ears, to have heard
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52840:4"/> how the men swore <hi>Walsingham</hi> the next morning, when they awak'd? Some for being disappointed in the it Morning Exercises, others not being able to remember where they had laid their Clothes when they went to bed. One miss'd his Shoes and Stockings; another his Perriwigg, Hat, Sword, Fring'd—Gloves; a nother was confin'd to his Chamber for want of his Breeches and Coat. They that had but one Suit were in a miserable Condition; they who had two were great losers however, for the Women carried away Silver, Gold, Watches, French, Tweezers, and all away, they had only reason to laugh, who had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened their Wives, by losing all their Money the night before.</p>
            <p>Upon the tenth of the month <hi>Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterion</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> according to the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonian</hi> Accompt, and in the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fortieth Bissextile or Leap year from the Reign of Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Female-Parliament open'd.

From whence I have conceiv'd assured Hopes, that all things will tend by your painful endeavours to the Dignity and Profit of the Female-Common-weale. You all know how we have suffered for a long-time under the Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of men, who have all this while taken upon them to govern the Business of the World, in their Councils, Assemblies and Cabals, while we ti'd to our Distaffs, and our Needles, have slothfully deserted our own Cause.</hi>—</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52840:5"/>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> quo' the Speaker—<hi>Pray here me out—You shall speak as much as you please when it comes to your Turn▪—in the mean time hear me out</hi>—Now I say Ladies, that from this oppression <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

With that they cry'd out all together, <hi>Go on, my Lady Speaker, go on</hi>—The interruption thus over—Bishops, said she, have their Convocations, Souldiers their Councils of War, even Emmets have their assemblies upon <hi>Ant-Hills;</hi> only Women of all other Creatures are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd from all Society. <hi>Ay truly▪ Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam so they are</hi>—Pray be quiet there—Can't you hold one minute
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52840:5"/> or two?—I think the Devil's in ye all—And so having procur'd a third silence, she proceeded. Nor have we undertaken, Ladies, a thing that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpted before, for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I have read a story of one <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> Who this <hi>Heliogabulus</hi> was, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you nor me; But I am sure he was an Emperor, and in his time the Woman had their Senates &amp; Assemblies to consult of publick affairs as well as Men. This Example of our Ancestors for some time intermitted, it behoves us now to restore. Never more need—We find how that under the Reigns of Men your Monarchs are nothing but wars and destructions: the Divines are at daggers drawing with the Divines; the Philosophers at Mortal Enmity with the Philosophers; nothing but confusion in the World; which makes me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if the Reins of Government were delivered into our hands, it would go much better with the world then it does; let me advise ye therefore Ladies and Gentlewomen, to consider the great work ye have in hand, not to be tumultuous in your disputes, but to shew your selves moderate and discreet; for that it behoves us to out-do our Oppressors,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52840:6"/> Men as well in Fact as in Talk; by which means when we have got the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World into our hands, we may be able to keep it by prudence and good Management. But above all things Ladies beware of quarrelling about tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial things; have a care of peaching one another: For Women are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that Women do those things in secret which they would not have all the World know; therefore if any Gentlewoman or Lady be privy to any secret of her Friend, let her by no means divulge it in Heat and Passion; for that would be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to lay her self, but her intimate also open so our Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. And they heaven knows, when they find that Women lay themselves open, are apt enough to take all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages against them; therefore I say Ladies, and Gentlewomen beware how ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your selves; for women like all sorts of Commodities, lose their intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick value, by being too often exposed, we are not therefore now to expose our selves, but to oppose our selves; we are to oppose our selves against the Crafts▪ wiles, Subtilties and Polices of those that have for so many hundred years enslav'd us, and when we have brought our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52840:6"/> Tyrants under our Girdles, they'l then be glad to <hi>expose, repose, depose, compose,</hi> or any <hi>pose</hi> that we shall <hi>impose</hi> upon 'em. And then Wee'l pick and choose, and leave and refuse—I have seen Women quarrel, and scold, and wrangle, and fight, and scratch one another at Church, and all about the precedency in a Pew; To prevent any such disorders in this great assembly let me advise ye in the first place, to let the most noble to take place according to their several degrees, and the Antiquity of those degrees. Let the Commoners take place according to the number of Children which they have brought forth; let others rank themselves according to their ages, of which they shall be bound to bring a Certificate out of the Parish Church Book; and let them that never had any Children sit lowermost; as for the Widows let them that have Children sit in the Middle between the Married Mothers; but for them that have none, nor ever had, let them sit lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of all. Thus Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, I have as briefly as I could, tho I know with no little force upon your Patience, declar'd to you the end of this Assembly; go therefore together and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52840:7"/> be quick in your dispatches; for by that means it may so fall out that we may surprize our Enemies; and I have heard my Husband say that the Surprize of one Town is more honourable than the taking of ten by force: therefore if we can, let us surprize our Enemies.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Madam Quaint</hi> being thus elected was immediatly ordered to the Chair,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52840:9"/> and to distinguish her from the rest, appointed to sit with a Chamber-pot upon her head, and a Tobacco Pipe in her Mouth. But then what to do for a Mace they could not tell: <hi>Madam Rash</hi> propounded to send for the large <hi>Rams-Horn Mace</hi> that was used to be carried before the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent of the <hi>Bulls-feather</hi> Clubb; and urg'd that nothing could be more convenient, for two Reasons; first, said she, the Horns are our own gift, so that we may make use of 'em when we please, and when we have done with 'em restore 'em again; if not the same, yet much larger and fairer. Secondly, it will be a great terror to our Husbands, to see what they must trust to, if they disturb us in our designs.</p>
            <p>How! said <hi>Madam Lofty,</hi> I'le never yield to it while I breath. Horns are the only Marks of Ignominy that we can bestow upon our Husbands; and stall we take their Marks of Ignominy from 'em, and appropriate 'em to our selves? No—in the name of vertue let 'em e'n carry them to their Graves.</p>
            <p>With that, up stept the Lady <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himne,</hi> a great Poetess, and Antiquary besides, I think, quo' she, Ladies, I may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52840:9"/> easily reconcile this difference among us.

               </gap>cted Men: for if it were not for those Utensils of theirs whene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> arises our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to men, I know not I profess, of what use they would be to us; as I hope I shall make out in this Honourable House when time serves. Now Ladies, one of these Truncheons thus adorn'd was presented to me from beyond the Seas for a great peice of Antiquity, and is at the service of this Assembly if they order me to send for it; thereupon they cry'd out all together, <hi>Nemine c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicente, send for it, send for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When it was brought into the House, <hi>vertu goi!</hi> What a twittering, and gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and teighing, there was from one end of the Room to the other. It was viewed without any remorse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; not one that lock'd upon it through her Fingers: <hi>Madam Rantipol</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52840:10"/> laugh'd out right—by my Fackins Ladies, quo' she, I never could find what my Husbands devices were good for before; for I'le assure ye Ladies, they are more for Ornament then use. Thereupon it was ordered that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thanks of the House should be given to the <hi>Lady Polyhimne</hi> for her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable present of such a proper Mace, which was presently delivered to Mrs. <hi>Taradoodle,</hi> Sargeantess Attendant.</p>
            <p>Having proceeded thus far they settl'd their several Commettees, one to draw up the heads of their Greivances against the Male Sex; and to consider of a speedy way of Redress, and of the fittest way to cast off the Yoke of Tyranny which they had so long groan'd under: another of due Elections, in case of the decease of any of their Members, a third for Religion, not that they car'd so much for the Religion Established, as what Religion to set up upon the Alteration of Government; as believing that the Mens and their Religion would never agree. The fourth and last was for Trade; which as they said had been very much abus'd by forraign Interlopers; a fifth Committee was also appointed to look over the statute Books and Law Cases
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52840:10"/> which had been made during the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Men, and to report what Laws were fit to be repeal'd, and what to be added for the advantage of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Commonweal. The same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was also to consider of scandalous and seditious Books and Pamphlets.</p>
            <p>Presently cry'd the Lady <hi>Twittle-cum-Twattle,</hi> I have heard my Husband talk much of these Commitees,—I I dont like these Commitees—No by my truly I don't like it, that some must be pack't one way into one Room others another way into another Room, and there forsooth they must have all the Talk by themselves, and we must sit here by our selves, and not hear a word what they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay—No, no, by my Faith, that's not the way; I say let's talk all together. I am for that Court ye call <hi>Dover Court,</hi> all Speakers and no Hearers,—the Lady <hi>Polihimne</hi> took her up, and told her that he Method of Parliamentary proceedings requir'd Committees to prepare Matter, and that then they were altogether to consider the Reason of things.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Lady Wrath</hi> mov'd that every Membresses Husband (to begin with them first for example sake) might be sent for by Mrs. <hi>Taradoodle</hi> Serjeantess at Arms, and made to kneel at the Bar—

And not only so, but that he had bound her up with an <hi>Italian</hi> Padlock, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> as he call'd it; that she had still continud under this heavy Oppression, had she not been very watchful of Opportunity's, and one night when her Husband came home drunk as a Rat, pick'd his Pocket, as he lay in the fetters of a sound Sleen, of the Key of her Horselock, by which means she got her heels out of Bondage and made her Escape to a Neighbours House in her Smock, and there borrow'd the Cloaths she had on to make her perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Appearance according to Summons▪

            <p>Which Complaints so incens'd the whole Assembly, that they flew high at the poor Men, and came to several Resolves.</p>
            <p>Resolv'd, that who ever should lock up his Wife in a Trunk or chest out of a Tyrannous design to keep or restrain her from gadding abroad at her own will and pleasure, shall be reputed a Capital Enemy to the Female Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal.</p>

            <p>Resolv'd, that an <hi>Italian Padlock</hi> is a most unspeakable Grievance to the Female Common-weal, and an insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable breach of the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>Resolv'd, that who ever shall by force and violence make use of an <hi>Italian</hi> Padlock, to debar his Wife from the free Exercise of her Conscience, and the performance of such charitable duties, or otherwise, that she shall think her self oblig'd to, or to be convenient for her Health or Recreation, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a Capital Enemy to the Famale Common-weal, and as such shall be prosecuted to death.</p>
            <p>Thereupon they order'd an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be drawn up against the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Offenders for High Treason, the one for Chest-Empounding, the other for Chaining and padlocking up his Lawful Soveraign Wife, contrary to the known Laws of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal of <hi>Amazonia.</hi>

Nor do they want stories of the Inconstancy, Infidelity, Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Treachery, falseness, and deceit of Men; nor fresh Examples of delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Virgins stollen out of their School, and afterwards rejected, scorn'd, abus'd, misus'd, contemn'd and slighted by their once the fondest, kindest, most
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52840:17"/> protesting vowing, submissive Spaniel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Lovers in the World. And these things almost with their milk, cause them to suck in an inbred harred of the Male Sex; so that a Virgin that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as but a barly Corn of discretion is as shie of a Man, as a Wheel-Dogg of a Cook-Maid. A man may as soon lay falt upon a Titmouses tayl, as come near to touch 'em; They will rather trust to the satisfaction of three pil'd velvet, then have to do with that Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Man.</p>
            <p>By my truly, cry'd the Lady <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Clack,</hi> I'le tell ye Mrs. Speaker, I have been at one of these Boarding-Schools my self, and there we had a Woman to teach us <hi>French,</hi> Laud—what a pretty melting Language it is! But the Subject I met with melted me even into a gelly of Extasie; for this <hi>French</hi> Woman had a pretty little neat Book (if I had it here I could kiss it) call <hi>Esehole defilles.</hi> In this Book she would often read with great delight: which I observing, fed her with Cakes and sweetmeats (for my Mother, Mrs. Speaker always allow'd me Mony▪ in my Pocket) and never let her alone, till I made her read it all over to me;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52840:17"/> But Laud—You cannot imagin Mrs. Speaker, what strange Passions it wrought in me! I minded my work no more—no more—no more, Mrs. Speaker what shall I say—no more then a man that is going up the Ladder to be hang'd minds a new suit of Cloaths—Laud—there were such Expressions in it as made my blood daunce <hi>new Boree,</hi> and the Tricketee's in every vain—Then she told me of another Book, call'd <hi>Ragionamenti D'Aretino:</hi> but that she said was in <hi>Italion</hi> and she did nor understand it. But I got another that did, and made her read it all over to me, and paid her weekly till she had done; then she told me of another Book, call'd <hi>Aloysia sigea,</hi> which was in Latin, and beyond her Spheare too. Thereupon I enquir'd after a Woman that understood Latin, and mony that finds out all things, soon found me an Interpreter, and I can assure ye Mrs Speaker, that it is not for nothing, that Latin is call'd the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Whore▪</hi> For certainly never did any Book in this World give such an absolute and perfect accompt of <hi>Cupids</hi> Tacticks as that Book: 'tis a Book so ravishing—I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52840:18"/> lost my Virginity with only▪ hearing it read—And I am perswaded that were it translated▪ there would not be a Virgin in the Town, by that time a Girl had read her Primmer out—which woul'd certainly increase our contempt and hatred of Men, when we could have our Business done by hearing only, without being beholding to the sence of feeling. However by this means and cost I got that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by fourteen, that had this Noble Assembly been then Summon'd, I should have tak'n it very ill to have been left out.</p>
            <p>But now I am to ask the Lady's that spoke last what sort of Virgins they mean? Whither Virgins so indeed, or Virgins so reputed? If Virgins so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, then I confess it were a madness to admit into such an Assembly as this, and up upon Affairs of so great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, Girles of Ten or Eleven years of Age, from whose discretion we can expect nothing of Counsel or Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But if they be Virgins so reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there can be none fitter for our turn; for they have certainly been deluded by Men, and must therefore of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be their Mortal Enemys. Secondly,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52840:18"/>
'tis a great sign that they are persons of Conduct and knowledge, that they can so well conceal their Losses, and put a cheat upon the World without being discovered. We shall wont dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Females to deal with Male Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and therefore my humble motion is that all reputed Virgins after years of discretion may be admitted.</p>
            <p>Here the Lady <hi>Squeamish</hi> started a new Hair, demanding what should be done with Virgins through necessity, that is to say, such as had Marry'd Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs for their Husbands?</p>
            <p>How said the Lady <hi>Nimble Clack,</hi> I conceive Mrs. <hi>Speaker,</hi> this question is easily answered; for if they have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Eunuchs and continu'd Virgins, without seeking to revenge the Injury done them, they are Fools indeed, and consequently not fit to have any Room in this Place. And yet one would think there are none that should shew less mercy to Men, then they that have been so vilanously abus'd by them; I am perswaded, if there be one that will patiently suffer under such a disgrace, there can be but one in the World at a time, and that's the Phoenix the Poets have so much talk'd of, for so many
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52840:19"/> years; and therefore if such a one do chance to come in among Us, wee'l nere turn her out for the Rarities sake.</p>
            <p>By and by there was one stood up, whose name could never yet be known, and mov'd, that Women who had been thrice marry'd might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>How quo' the Lady <hi>Lustfull,</hi> looking upon her with great disdain! What self-denying Philosophress have we got here? I have turn'd off two already, and the third is pitching over the Petch. Pray Madam, give me leave to be shod round; why should the having of five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten one after another, hinder a Woman from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Member of this House? By my troth, I am for the <hi>French</hi> Proverb re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verst. <hi>The Husband of her whom God Loves soon Dyes.</hi> And I my Conscience she's the best Commons-wealth Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that can hold out to send most to Old Nick; that's our Complaint, the Worlds over stock'd with 'em. And therefore the Old Amazon's wrung off the neck, of all their Mate Squabbs, but only a few of the Choicest which they kept for Breed and Recreation. Nay, I know no reason why a Woman that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52840:19"/> kicks off three or four Husbands, or forty or fifty, one after another into the other World, ought not to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at so much a head as the <hi>Welch</hi> were for killing of Wolves; especially seeing the K. of <hi>Spain</hi> is so liberal to those that get Male Children. For we must act by Maximes contrary to those of Men Monarchs, what they build we must destroy; and therefore let no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be put out of this Assembly for good Service.</p>
            <p>This debate being over the House adjourn'd till to morrow at nine of the Clock.</p>
            <p>As the Lower House was thus all in a Hurley Burley, so was the Upper not without some share of Mutiny and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.</p>
            <p>For upon the passing of a certain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Lady <hi>Fisgigg</hi> Baroness of <hi>Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Hall</hi> being desir'd to give her vote, and demanding in what form she was to do it, the Countess of <hi>Mount Orgueil,</hi> told her, by saying <hi>content</hi> or <hi>not content,</hi> How, quo' the Lady <hi>Fisgigg,</hi> I say I am content!

            </p>
            <p>The Dutches of <hi>Decay'd Vertue</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to convince her, that it was only a word of course to shew her dislike or Approbation of what was propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; don't tell me, quo' the Lady <hi>Fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gigg,</hi> i'le agree or disagree as I please, but i'le be contented with nothing, I sit here i'this House with a Soul above that of a Commoner: and I must tell ye, <hi>To be content,</hi> is for a Woman to confine and limit her Desires, which i'le never controul by saying I am <hi>contented;</hi> what a God's name, is there no other word in the World for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to signifie her approbation of a thing but to say she is <hi>Content?</hi> The Dutches of <hi>Babylon</hi> alleadg'd that it was the Form which the Men had us'd time out of mind, and very properly too, quo' the Lady <hi>Fisgigg,</hi> Content and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52840:20"/> Cuckoldry go commonly together.</p>
            <p>Thereupon many debates arose what Alteration to make of the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The Countess of <hi>Pennsil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ania</hi> urg'd, that they were not to alter Old Customes for one Lady's humour; but the Dutches of <hi>Female Charmes</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and said, that Niceties were not to be stood upon, where the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was easie, and therefore mov'd that to shew their consent, they should all clap their hands, and the Dissenters should cry <hi>hiss</hi>—as they did at the Play-Houses.—But the Lady <hi>Fisgigg</hi> utterly rejected that Motion, saying, that the Mode of the Play-Houses ill became the Grandure of such a Solemn Assembly,—thereupon the Countess of <hi>Rale-the-Roast</hi> stood up and swore there could be nothing better to shew their agreement, then to cry three times Ay, Ay, Ay; and to shew their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to make a wrie face and cry <hi>Shawaw,</hi> and then to tell the Shawaws, and the Ay, Ay, Ayes. So that if the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waws were more than the Ay, Ays, then to let the Shawaws carry it; and if the Ay, Ay's out-did the Shawaws, let the Ay, Ay's carry it, which after a great Sputter and bustle was carry'd by 3 voices.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52840:21"/>
            <p>While they were in the Midst of these-Contentions, a Message came to the Upper House, to signifie that the Commoners desir'd to have a <hi>Mess of Chat</hi> with their Ladyships.</p>
            <p>For you must know that when the word <hi>Conference</hi> was mentioned in the Lower House, there was great distast tak'n at it by the Lady <hi>Nimble-Clack,</hi> with your good Leave, Mrs. Speaker, quo' she, I do not understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this word <hi>Conference;</hi> these men by going to School, and learning their Latin Tongue, have so confounded us with their Chap-screwing Expressions, that it is high time for Us now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our Language to its primitive plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Now I know what it meant by it, when we say come Neighbours, let us meet together such a time and have a <hi>Dish of Chat</hi> together, so 'tis another Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome among Us, when we design to go to the House of Office together, as we seldom go single, if we can get Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, we say, come let us go to such a place, and have a <hi>Dish of Chat;</hi> and thus when we come from making a Visit, we do not say, we have been at a <hi>Conference;</hi> Or when we have been
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52840:21"/> at a Christning, or an Upsitting, where we discourse of sundry Things, and Passages, we do not say we have been at a <hi>Conference;</hi> God bless us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my humble Motion is, that the words in the Message may be, that we <hi>desire a Dish of Chat</hi> with their Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Voluble</hi> approv'd of this Motion exceedingly: for, said she, I know no more how to manage a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> then the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> but I can hold a <hi>Chat</hi> from New years Day to New-years Day, and so to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years Day again.</p>
            <p>This being agreed, the next thing mov'd was, Who, and how many should go to this <hi>Dish of Chat.</hi> How, quo' Madam <hi>Tomboy,</hi> Who and How Many! Is it come to that? By this Light I'le go for one, who everstayes behind. And I, cryes another; and I, cryes a third; and I, cryes a fourth; and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I; which that there was such a Terrible Dinn of <hi>and I's,</hi> that the noise of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen steeple's with twelve Bells a peice was but meer Whispering to it; which was no sooner ceas'd, but presently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed such a horr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now they were all got Higgledy Piggledy together, Peeresses and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners without Distinction one among another; at what time, Madam <hi>Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> addressing her self to the Lady Speaker.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52840:27"/> most famous of their Conquerours were all subdu'd in the heighth of their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs by Women; <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Scipio, Caesar</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> loar'd and cring'd before their Mistresses like so many Setting Dogs: they acted with the Spirits of their Mistresses, and won all their Victories with their Mistresses Souls; by which it is plain that nature gave Us the Propriety, however we came to be such Kitlings to lose it. Men are Brutish, rash and heady, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men smooth and temperate, which render them much more fit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Women have their tears at Command; which proves them to be the greatest dissemblers in the World, and it is a Maxim, that they who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to dissemble, can never tell how to Govern; it follows then that they who can best dissemble are most fit to rule.</p>
            <p>Madam, quo' the Lady <hi>Nimble Clack,</hi> you have talk'd out your ounce, now let me talk out mine.</p>
            <p>No by my Faith shan't ye, reply'd the Lady <hi>Polyhimne,</hi> I came here to talk, and I'le talk out my talk as well as the best of Ye.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52840:27"/>
            <p>Laud, quo' Madam <hi>Nimble Clack,</hi> how I long to talk, and this scurvy Women won't let me—My Lady Speaker forsooth—Have a little Patience Madam—Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will do no good, Madam 'tis just at my Tongues End; 'tis like Bottle Ale, twill fly out in spite of my Teeth—Put a crust of Bread i' your mouth Madam, 'twill allay the fury of the Froth—Put a T—d i' my mouth, shan't I?—I protest and vow before all this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly if ye won't let me talk, I'le Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; and so saying, the Vehemency of her Passion overcame her Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in such a manner, that she sank down in a Swoon. Which put the whole House into such a fit of Gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, as would have silenc'd all the Hammers of a Paper-Mill.</p>
            <p>It was in vain to think of <hi>Assa Faeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> being so far off from any great Town, therefore they unrip'd a Bolster, and set a whole Bushel of Feathers a Smoaking under the Ladies Noise, which created another disorder, of far greater Consequence; for the Smoak of the Feathers caus'd such a filthy stink from one end of the Room to the other,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52840:28"/> that some fell a coughing, some fell a sneezing, but all fell a Trumping about with such a general concurrence, as if they had resolv'd since they could not make use of their Tongues, to carry on the work of the Day with their Tayles; there was Answer and Reply, Rejoynder and Surrejoynder, Rump—Trump, Bump—Thump with such a <hi>Continuando,</hi> as if Destiny had done it on purpose to try the strength of their Lower Bellows as well as their upper Lungs. So that the Lady Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er finding there was no more good to be done that day, was forc'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ the House till the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Being re-assembled the next Morning the Lady <hi>Polyhimne</hi> continu'd her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; for she had clearly got the day of the Lady <hi>Nimble Clack,</hi> who was forc'd to keep her Chamber all the next day to recover her lost Spirits, and to have her Nostrills cleans'd, which were grown so full of soot with the smoak of the Feathers, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to hang a wet sheet before her Face, and shoot off a Musket right against the tip of her Noise; so that the Lady <hi>Polyhimne</hi> being at liberty thus proceeded.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52840:28"/>
            <p>In the next place, quo' she, none can be thought to have a greater affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for their Country then Women, how many example's have we of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have cut off their hair to make Ropes for Engins, and strings for Bows. Who have been more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral then they without the constraint of taxes and assessments, to throw their Rings and Jewels into the Publick trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to defray the charges of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted Exchequer? Who redeemed her Country from the slavery of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Victor but <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Arque,</hi> so that 'tis they and not the Universities that are Properly to be call'd the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing mothers of the People; I bless my self to consider, were our Noble Sex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to that Right which nature has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd upon it, what quiet and serenity the Common-weal would enjoy, there would be no Room for Factions and Underminings, but all things would flow into Liberty and pleasure; Instead of raking every Corner of the land for Armies, there would be nothing but preparing for Masques, and Amorous Appointments, Men should then follow their Handy Crafts.—</p>

I assure ye, if we get the Government into our hands 'tis the first thing I shall put 'em upon; for by my Soul, My Lady Speaker, I would will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly that all the Fleas i' the Land were chain'd, they do so plague me at night,—'Tis thought she would have run on with the History of Flea's, but that my Lady Speaker assur'd her that care should be taken of that affair in due time, thereupon she sat down and the Lady <hi>Polyhimne</hi> proceeded.—</p>
            <p>I say, quo' she, that then Men should follow their handy crafts, as we should set them at work, the Ox might plow, and the blind Mil-horse turn about the Wheel in security, while all their sweat and labours should but serve for the use and splendor of our Courts, and Habitations.</p>
            <p>And then for slights and cunning tricks requisite for those that govern a state, where does the Devil reside but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52840:29"/> among our Sex, for what by our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, glances, traines, Slights, Ambushes, Artificies and little Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities it is impossible for any Mortal to escape Us; we are so giv'n to deceive, it is impossible to deceive Us. But some may object, that we are <hi>Inconstant,</hi> the fitter then are we for all occasions of business, they that can turn and vere about ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the wind serves, can never ship-wrack; whereas obstinate Men fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently split themselves and their Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sterity by being too opiniater'd and fix'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Course.</p>
            <p>Marry Gap—cry'd <hi>Madam Sensual,</hi> what fools are they say Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are inconstant? I appeal to the whole Assembly, My Lady Speaker, whither it be not a confounded lye of the Male Sex, an Aspersion, Madam, a meer Aspersion, for let me ask ye a few Questions, my Lady Speaker. Do not the Women scold in these our daies as they did formerly? Do they not sit in the Winter time toasting their <hi>Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Dedees</hi> before the fire, as they did formerly? Do they not Sip and Weep at Burials as they did formerly? Do they not Cuckold their Husbands, as they did formerly? Do they not exhaust
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52840:30"/> and tire their Gentlewoman Ushers, as they did formerly? Do they not love Rambling and Coaches, Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Spring Gardens as they did formerly? Do they not love to amble between the sheets as much as ere they did? Nay to be short, are they more Inconstant then ere they were? Constant even in Inconstancy; And who then can say that Women are Inconstant?</p>
            <p>Beshrew your heart, quo' the Lady <hi>Polyhimne,</hi> for taking the words out of my Mouth, for this is no more then I intended to have spoke; truly my <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Speaker,</hi> quo' the Lady <hi>Sensual,</hi> I was een ready to <hi>run over,</hi> and could not hold; and I must needs say, quo' the Lady <hi>Polyhimne,</hi> you <hi>ran</hi> over very much to the purpose; and truly I am very glad you did so, for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Excuse, my Lady Speaker, of the Gentlewoman that spake last, puts me in mind of another great Objection against Us, that we are <hi>Talkative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is just according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>The Kettle calls the Porridge Pot Black-Arse;</hi> I would fain know which is most Talkative, the Female or the Male Sex? The Men forsooth can sit talking and prating in a Tavern an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52840:30"/> hour, nay two or three hours together, and no body must contradict 'em; Nay they are so vain-gloriously conceited of their Prittle Prattle as to trouble the World with it in Print; we talk 'tis true, and perhaps sometimes as they do little to the Purpose, but we never Print to no Purpose; a free talkative Ruler shews his Familiarity to the People, while a reserv'd and sparing utter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r of Quarter Sentences, one that would have the People know his meaning by his Gaping, leaves the People in suspence, and makes liberty either dangerous, or flattery misconster it.</p>
            <p>To conclude as Women bring forth Children, and multiply the World, and when they have brought them forth, are most tender and careful to bring them up; so it is most fitting, since they have all these Pre-eminencies and Indulgencies of Nature, that they should have the Government of the World which they have multiply'd and stor'd with the Fruit of their own Wombs. And I must tell ye, My Lady <hi>Speaker,</hi> by my consent, would all the Women agree to 't, we would not bring one Child into the World more, but suffer all the race of Manking to perish, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52840:31"/> Kings might be without Subjects, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths without Inhabitants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they would submit to let us have our wills, and suffer Us to Govern 'em that brought 'em into the World; which if we had not done, they had never been; and then what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all the Pomp and Tyranny which they so unreasonably usurp?</p>
            <p>Quo' Madam <hi>Rash,</hi> I like this Project very well, and humbly move it may be taken into farther consideration. In the mean time my Lady <hi>Speaker,</hi> give me leave to add one reason more to prove, that the Government of the World belongs to the Female Sex; which I look upon to be the greatest, in regard it is the General Women's Reason, and so I say that Women ought to Govern the World rather then Men; <hi>because they ought.</hi> And this is a Reason which no Man yet from the Lord to the Peasaut ever durst contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, thus when my Husband asks me the Reason, why I will do such or such a thing, I answer, <hi>because I will;</hi> at which his mouth is presently bung'd up, he dares not mutter a word more; then again, if you ask me How I prove such a thing to be true? say I, <hi>Because
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52840:31"/> it is;</hi> if you demand, why I will have it done so, I answer presently without studying like your Hum drum Porers upon Books, <hi>Because I will:</hi> tell me any argument among Men without all their chopping of Logick, was ever so universally prevalent, and therefore should the Men ask Us why we should have the Government of the World ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they, the reason's at hand, <hi>Because we will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This convincing Reason split the Hair, and it was resolv'd upon the Question, that let any one bring a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Reasons after this, there should not one be receiv'd.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Lady <hi>Polyhimne</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to urge any more Reasons, and was going to proceed to Examples. Quo' she, my Lady <hi>Speaker,</hi> I shall now make bold to offer some Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Women that have been more famous for their Gorvernment then ever Men were—she had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mention'd the Word <hi>Examples,</hi> but the Lady <hi>Nimble Clack,</hi> whose tongue was then running like the <hi>Flye</hi> of <hi>Jack,</hi> flung immediatly into the Throng—bear leave Ladies, quo' she, let me come—Hold, my Lady Speaker,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52840:32"/> Hold—I'me just coming as fast as I can—Hold Mrs. Speaker—Pray hold—Ladies pray give Room—stand aside pray La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>To omit Heathen story, quo' the Lady <hi>Polyhimne, Deborah</hi> did the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Barach</hi> was but the Instrument</p>

            <p>The next day, the assembly being met again with every one a good Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation i' their Bellies, Madam <hi>She Devil</hi> propounded a General Massacre▪ and put them in mind of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Vespers, the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, the Destruction of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and the Massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that a certain number of Women might be sent in Men's Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to the Colledges of the Jesuits, there to learn their Maxims and Methods of proceeding in order to the carrying on so pious a work. This she said was a sure way, according to the <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Dead Men never bite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dutchess of <hi>Female Charms</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the milder way of Resignation, then Chronicle 'em for Fools indeed, quo' Madam <hi>She-Devil;</hi> there's a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal with all my Heart, Oh quo' the Dutchess you don't consider the force of <hi>Female Charmes;</hi> Women do Miracles with those Engins, the Magnificent <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> with all his Pomp and Pride was not able to resist the Charms of his <hi>Roxohana,</hi> then I am able to take the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52840:36"/> Moon by the Teeth, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what was hinted by a worthy Lady the other day concerning the <hi>Nick of time;</hi> then again, they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be guided by reason. If so, we are able to give them a thousand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons more then they are able to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; If they are Govern'd by reason, we command that reason, and reason must be of our side, or else wee'l send Reason to the Devil. But suppose that the Male Sex had all the reasons in their heads, I am sure they carry none i' their Breeches, and there lies the chief Rudder of their Passions; there we stand at the Helm and can guide it as we please our selves. Ay, but, quo' the Lady <hi>She-Devil,</hi> why should we put things to the Hazard? <hi>Tomyris</hi> made sure work, she cut off <hi>Cyrus's</hi> Head; nay she did not think him safe then, till she had drownded his head and him to another Death in his own Blood. But cruelty, quo' the Dutchess of <hi>Female Charmes,</hi> is a thing so unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to our Sex—Y'are a Fool, reply'd the Lady <hi>She-Devil,</hi> why should we be less cruel to Men, then they are to themselves? We daily see how they destroy one another without Mercy,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52840:36"/> without Compassion, worse then the wildest of beasts, that never prey upon their own kind. Bears will not prey upon Bears, nor Wolves upon Wolves, Lyons live in amity among themselves, and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers live in Unity with Tigers. Only Men devour one another, and what pains do they take to do all this? What hardships do thay endure to compass their designs of Mischief? Heats and Colds, Hunger and Thrist, Wounds, loss of Limbs, slavery and what not? Now if the Women save them all this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and do their own drudgery for 'em, by sending 'em from one quiet sleep to another, what injury do they do 'em?</p>
            <p>But the Dutchess of <hi>Female Charmes,</hi> still abhoring Cruelty argu'd stiffly against all such Barbarous Proceedings; and to stop the Lady <hi>She-Devils</hi> Mouth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to get in fee with the Ministers, to perswade the Men to a Resignation upon the score of Conscience. The Women have been always their Great Friends hitherto, and therefore they had all the Reason i'the World to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige their Benefactresses with their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Diligence, and I make no question, quo' she, if they would set to work, but that they who could prove the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52840:37"/> of the Imposition of <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> by their great Book learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may much more easily prove the right of the Female Sex to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of the World from the same Authorities, I'le undertake (quo' she) that am no Preacher to prove it from the Confession of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> to King <hi>Darius</hi> himself; <hi>O ye Men,</hi> said he, <hi>it is not the Multitude of Men that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth, who is it then that Ruleth them, or has Lordship over them? are they not Women?</hi> By which words it is plain that Women have the sole Right of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie, which being so, then steps in the Common Text, give <hi>Caesar</hi> his due. Now to prove that by <hi>Caesar</hi> is meant <hi>the Women</hi> is the casiest thing for a nimble quick witted, Rhetorical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanger of Parodoxes to prove in the World; And the thing being once prov'd, then 'tis matter of Conscience to obey, or else there's Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation i'the Case.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>She-Devil</hi> reply'd, that many men had no Conscience, and that it was a usual thing among 'em to venture Eternity to rule the Roast in this World for ten or twelve Years; I have read of one <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>Fifth,</hi> that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52840:37"/> he was so ardently Ambitious of being <hi>Pope</hi> that he gave his Soul to the Devil for a lease of the Popedom, but for seven years, out of which the Devil couzen'd him of two to boot.</p>
            <p>The Dutchess reply'd, that those were not many perhaps two or three in a Kingdom, and might therefore be easily brought to conformity. And for that reason to avoid Massacre and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, there was no way like working upon the Consciences to bring men to a Resignation; For that men were like Trouts: if you can but once come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>With that the <hi>Dutches</hi> of <hi>Decay'd Vertue</hi> stood up, and having highly applauded the Lady that spoke last, by my feth, quo' she, I have quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prospect then any of ye all. For here of late days I find the men go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to destroy themselves faster then we can do it; I find such a vast increase of the Number of Taverns, such an infinite Rendezvouze to the Swelltubs of damn'd adulterated, slumm'd and poisonous Mixtures of all sorts of that noble juice
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52840:39"/> call'd Wine, such a General debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shery; such a Universal thirst has seiz'd the Nation, and plung'd it into such a Sea of Drunkenness, that we shall see in short time the Men fall like Autumn leaves from the Tree of Life, and drop into their graves like rotten Plumbs; and then the Government of this Land, and what need we care for any other, will descend into our hands whither we will or no. And therefore Ladies take my advice, have a little Patience, I find the Tyde-turning already; the word <hi>Patience</hi> alarum'd the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses of <hi>Stormland</hi> and <hi>Rule-the-Rost.</hi> Patience! quo' they, is this a time for Patience? Let us break forth into open Rebellion—and first seize all our Husbands Arms.—I say, let us take away their Weapons—let me have 'em disabl'd, and the way to disable 'em is to take away their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; and thats the way to make 'em as tame as Capons; the way to tame your Lyons and your Mastiffs is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditate 'em, that is to pare their claws close to the flesh; let us stop up all the Iron and Lead mines; they destroy the Wood of the Country. Let us cut out their Drum heads, burn their pikes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52840:39"/> break their Swords; and then for their Guns, said they, I, we have found out a way, when the men are at the Tavern, to stop 'em up and fill 'em with melted lead, and hide 'em in the Garret under the Maids Beds.</p>
            <p>When the Men are thus Disabl'd, let us proclaim open War against 'em; and when they are got drunk, then's our time so set upon them. I have seen (said the Countess of <hi>Storm▪ land</hi>) a Man drunk as <hi>David's</hi> Sow, and his Wife has come and pummel'd him, that you would have thought she had been pounding of Sorrel to make green Sawce; and the poor fellow has been able to make no more Resistance than a Log to the wedge and the Beetle, and why was this? Because the Man was disabl'd, I say then (said the Countess of <hi>Rule-the-Rost</hi>) let us first disable the Men, and then rise up against 'em as one Woman. Private Families are but the Epitomes of Great Common weals, and how many Women are there that are Mistresses and absolute Queens in their own private Territories? The reason is, because they rebel against their Husbands; and generally, when the Women have the courage to rebel,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52840:40"/> they get the victory; what should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, but that what Women do separately in their particular Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we thus united may do the same, in the great Body of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal; at large I am apt to believe we are three to one in number; that is one at the head, another at the feet, and the third i' the Middle; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be stubborn, and won't yield take a knife and disable him for good an all.</p>
            <p>Thus my <hi>Lady Speaker▪</hi> we have delivered our Opinions faithfull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and cordially, and out humble motion is, that the same may be put to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, the Question being put, it was unanimously resolv'd▪ that there should be a General Insurrection on the Women's side, and that notice should be given by the respective Membresses to the Women in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties to get themselves in a readiness and to put themselves in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture accordingly; but the Month, Day, and Hour was left to a farther debate▪ and so the whole Assembly adjourn'd till eight a Clock the next Morning.</p>

            <p>The next morning they met as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually again, as if they had been under a Club forfeiture of twelve pence a piece, and the first thing taken into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, was, what form of Government they should make use of when they had got the power i' their Clutches.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Dutchess of <hi>Babylon</hi> stood up and highly applauded the form of <hi>Confusion,</hi> which she alleadg'd to be the first, and consequently the most Ancient form of Government upon the Earth; for that the first time we read that the People of this world were ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass'd together in one Body, was at the Confusion of <hi>Babel;</hi> she argu'd farther, that as the sweetest Harmony is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by Discords; so the strickest uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was like to arise from Confusion; in like manner, said she, the <hi>Chaos</hi> was before the Creation, the wild Beasts of Desarts live without Statute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aws, Order or Discipline in a perpetual confusion and yet you shall not hear of one Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fought among 'em, once in a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years; and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s remarkable, that when People have liv'd some twenty years
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52840:41"/> or thereabouts in all the Peace and Tranquility imaginable, they are never at Quiet, till they are all in Confusion; nay, they make it their chiefest design to plot and contrive disordor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. And indeed the Form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion is most Agreeable to our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. View us at our Meetings, at our Gossippings, at our Christnings and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. What a Noise, what a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion is there among us? When one Woman happens to swoon at Church, what a Confusion is there among the rest? Go into every particular Family, and if she be a right Woman, that rules the roast, what a confusion is there? What is a Womans life without Brawling, Scolding, Rending, Tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing▪ Maundring, beating her Children, rating her Servants, reviling her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and all the whole house turn'd topsie turvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? It is as natural for a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to live in Confusion, as for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander to live in the Fire, or an Eel i' the Mud, and therefore I say the form of Confusion is the best form.</p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Baroness</hi> of <hi>Tongue▪ Castle</hi> standing up, My Lady Speaker, quo' she, before we come to any Resolution in this affair it behoves us to consider,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52840:41"/> what forms of Government there are, or have been in the World, that we may choose which we like best; you know Madam, that when we go to buy our Commodities at the Exchange we desire to see a great many Parcels afore we pitch upon that which pleases Us. And so it is requisite, that we should know what forms of Government there are before we conclude upon any certainty; Now I desire to know, whether ever there were any forms of Government or no; and if there were, how they are call'd, and by what marks they may be known.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Polyhimne</hi> reply'd, that there were several forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which were Commonly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd by the names of <hi>Manarchee,</hi> Aristocracy, and Dimmocracy, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, Olygarchee and Anarchy.</p>
            <p>Now the Devil take me, quo' the Baroness, if this ben't all conjuring to me; I could as well chaw a Pumice stone, as one of these words, have they no softer preserv'd▪ Apricot▪ Names than these? Why, now 'tis a strange thing, quo' the Lady <hi>Polyhimne,</hi> I'le un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, your Ladyship has r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52840:42"/> quo' the <hi>Baroness</hi>—and yet you never read <hi>Aristotles</hi> Politicks—Not I by my faith—I never heard of 'em before—why there 'tis, quo' the Lady <hi>Polyhimne,</hi> had you but read the one as well as the other, there you had found all these hard Names sitting like a Covey of Partridges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one side of a leaf of Paper. I bless my Education, I have read <hi>Aristotles</hi> Politicks, and the Lady <hi>Newcastles Oglio,</hi> and <hi>Hobbs's</hi> Leviathan, and can tell the meaning of all these hard Names.</p>
            <p>Pray then, quo' the Baroness, be so kind as to impart your knowledge.</p>
            <p>Why look ye then, quo' the Lady <hi>Polyhimne,</hi> a <hi>Manarchee</hi> is that form of Government when a State or Kingdom is under the Government of one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and this the Men have alwayes accompted, I beseech ye Madam, cry'd the Lady <hi>Lofty,</hi> be not so sharp and severe against Tyranny; for though we do not love to be Tyranniz'd over by others, 'tis meat and drink to Us to Tyrannize over others <hi>Paradise</hi> it self fore-told what <hi>Vexers</hi> we should be; and threw it then upon Us as a Curse: but we soon turn'd the Scales, and improv'd it to a blessing; esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52840:42"/> our selves never more happy than when we could Domineer and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over our Husbands: Had <hi>Cain</hi> been marry'd, he had never been put to the trouble to go a rambling to build Cities in the Land of <hi>Nod;</hi> His wise would have taken his revenge upon her self, and been glad of the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and therefore Ladies could we confine Tyranny within these Walls, and entayl it upon our heirs Females, 'tis not a pin matter whither Lawfully or unlawfully begotten, Tyranny were the most natural form of Government that we could desire, as being most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our <hi>Genius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You'l say 'tis impossible, but Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers would creep in among Us; that I answer, what have Men their Axes and Blocks, the Gibbets and Gallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for, but to cut off Interlopers. And then again, it is remarkable that the Male Tyranny have been the most du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Forms of Government in the World, witness the <hi>Turkish, Persian</hi> and <hi>Ethiopian▪</hi> Tyrannies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, said she, when your particular Committees consider of these things, let them not forget to think of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>

            <p>Madam <hi>Squeamish,</hi> not liking this discourse, alleadg'd that there was not a more chargeable form of Goverment in the World then Tyranny, which the covetous and griping humor of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be soon weary of.</p>
            <p>That the People under Tyranny liv'd poorly, miserably, wretchedly, neither able to defend themselves nor their Governors, that she lov'd to see the Subject in good plight, hearty and rich, blessing and not cursing their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; that they who had something to lose, would stick close to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, when they who had nothing to lose, car'd not a rush which way the World went, well knowing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot be worse than it is: That the safety of a Government consisted in the Natives and not in Forraigners, the usual guard of Tyranny, who would be in continual Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well! quo' the Countess of <hi>Whigg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> what think ye then of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth? that is such a form of Government where the <hi>Mobile</hi> bear all the sway—whereas they go along the streets, they march in couples, a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52840:43"/> Brewers wife, and Dutchess, an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise and a Countess, a Chandlers wife and Baroness, a Weavers wife and a Lady, the meaner still taking the Wall. Where Coaches must give way to Drays and Carts; and Porters are their own Gentlemen U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If I mistake not, quo' the Countess of <hi>Storm-land,</hi> the Lady that spoke last has not giv'n ye a true description of a Common-wealth; for in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, as I am told, there are neither Dutchess nor Countesses, nor Barones<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses nor Ladies, or if there were, so much the worse: for it would be very Improper for persons of Rank and Quality to be familiar with Soap and Candle-Grease; now do I think it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52840:44"/> to admit the <hi>Mobile</hi> to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by any means, for what saies the Proverb, <hi>Set Beggars a Horseback and they'l ride to the Devil.</hi> And when the Devil has once got our form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Clutches, who shall retrieve it out of his Pawes. I never lik'd any thing that was common i' my life; I hate the Fashion when it grows Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I can be merry and sipp off my glasses in a Countess-like-way; I can be kind to a friend when I see my time; but Common-toss pots, Common strumpets, Common-wealths, they're all alike.</p>
            <p>Madam, quo' the Lady <hi>Fleshly-giv'n,</hi> I cannot jump with your sentiments; for nature surely at first made all things Common, till Law and pretended Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity invented Hedges, and Bolts, and Bars, and Matrimony, and such like Usurpations of Propriety; the World was but one vast Common-wealth at first, till <hi>Mimrod</hi> first impal'd a part of it to himself by Tyrannical force, and taught others to follow his Example. And what do all these impalements and enclosures of law and necessity signifie? Not a Rush. For when nature is once set upon the Merry Pin, down go all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52840:44"/> these Fences of scarecrow Morality, and we suffer our selves to lye Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as at first, as it is naturally there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for Women to love Liberty, and to lay themselves Common, certainly there can be no form of Government so natural to the Female Sex as that of a Common-wealth which allow all the Liberty in the world.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Voluble</hi> reply'd that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were to take their liberty, what ever the form of the Government were. But as they lov'd liberty, so they lov'd honour, now what delight can the Women take (said she) in such a form of Government, where the highest Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their Ambition can reach to, is only to be call'd Plain Mrs. <hi>Burgomistress,</hi> how sneakingly it sounds; I appeal to ye All, Ladies, whither it be a thing rational for us to admit of such a form of Government that will admit a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man neither <hi>Grace,</hi> nor <hi>Honour;</hi> no, not the home-spun Title of <hi>your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> 'Tis true when ye are all in a body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>May that Woman die of a Clap that speaks for a Common-wealth for me, quo' the Lady <hi>Nimble Clack.</hi> Nay faith (quo' she) if your Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths won't allow us our Titles, and our Dignities, and our Precedencies, they have lost a friend of the Lady <hi>Nimble-Clack;</hi> a Woman had as good live in Hell as in a Common-wealth: Nay I am apt to believe, added she, that a Common-wealth is a kind of a Hell upon Earth. For there, they say, Popes, and Emperors, and Princes, Dutchesses, and Countesses, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, live Higgledy Piggledy without any more respect given 'em then we give to our Lacqueys; nay I am told the great Men of the World, <hi>Xerxes, Caesar, Pompey,</hi> &amp;c. are not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of their Hands, but forc'd to cry <hi>Mustard, Old Hats or Cloakes,</hi> and empty Houses of Office for their living▪ Which makes me think that Hell is a Common-wealth, and all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are Hell.</p>
            <p>There is another damn'd Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency in Common-wealths, quo' the Lady <hi>Voluble,</hi> going on—but to the best form that ever was in the world What? quo' the Lady <hi>Nimble Clack,</hi>

Ay, quo' Madam <hi>Nimble Clack,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>—Now you say something—Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a <hi>Phoenix,</hi> where will you find such another? She clapper claw'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in 88 and rod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a horse like any Thing—at <hi>Tilbury</hi> Camp—I have heard my Grandfather say she was a Woman of ten Thousand▪</p>

            <p>By my troth—quo' the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roness of <hi>Tongue-Castle,</hi> I never lik'd Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in my life—I have seen her Picture upon <hi>Ludgate,</hi> and methinks she was but a homely Woman.—And then, what a strange fashion'd Gown did she wear? I should be afraid, had I such a Gown, that my maid would mistake the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en shelves, and set up her Peuter round about my wast—Naw—Naw,—I am for none of your Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>—none of your Monarchee's, not I. By'r Lady, this is very fine indeed—I expected we should have been all Queens, and now to come and talk of a Plot—This smells like a Plot—and therefore my Lady Speaker, I humbly move wae may hear no more on't.—</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Lady Speaker desir'd Madam <hi>Polyhimne</hi> to give an account of the next form.</p>
            <p>Quo' she, the next form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that which the men call <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy;</hi> when the Government is in the hands of these that are of the highest Rank and Quality in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal; Ay marry—quo' the Lady <hi>Nimble Clack</hi> now ye say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>May we! cry'd the Lady <hi>Lofty</hi>—nay we will do't, and I would fain see that <hi>She</hi> that dares contradict my Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; my Fathers Fathers great Grand-Fathers Sons Father came in with <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and the Couqueror gave him Ten Castles, and fifteen Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships: and our Ancestors kept them too, till it was the Fashion for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to sell their Lands; and then you know, when a Fashion comes up, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one strives to be i' the Fashion.

Now as I did what I pleas'd, so every one i' the House did what they pleas'd, the Wenches sate up all Night with their Sweet-hearts, and did what they pleas'd: the Foot men and Pages Guzzl'd up the Wine and the strong Liqour and did what they pleas'd: the Dogs run away with whole Shoulders of Mutton and did what they pleas'd: Me thought it was the pleasantest sight in the World to see every Body do what they pleas'd—my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band mutter'd, and mumbled, and grumbled, of which I took little notice, but went on doing what I pleas'd; feasting my accquaintance, spending, Revelling, throwing the house out at Window, and at length I sent my Gentleman, you know who I mean.

            </p>
            <p>The whole House was astonish'd at the Wisdom of the Lady that spoke last, one said that <hi>Minerva</hi> her self had spoken, another cry'd that either some she Devil or else some <hi>Sybil</hi> spoke within her; and the Lady <hi>Nimble-Clack</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52840:52"/> was ready to put her brains out at her Ears, to think that she should be such a Dunce as not to hit of the Project, so that at length the whole House finding the Expedient to be unanswerable came to the following Resolutions.</p>
            <p>Resolv'd, that Anarchee is the most Proper form of Government, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Peace and Tranquility of the Female Common-weal.</p>
            <p>Resolv'd, that Anarchee being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to be such, it be the business of this House to settle and establish it with all convenient Speed.</p>
            <p>Resolv'd, that who ever by Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Writing, or Printing, shall utter or Publish any things to the prejudice or in Derogation of Anarchee, shall be adjudg'd and shall suffer as a Capital Enemy of the Female Sex.</p>
            <p>All which Resolves being Order'd to be drawn into Bills, the House adjourn'd till the next Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Die Sab. prox. post di. Sat. antecedente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the next day were Sunday, yet they were loath to lose a day, knowing how much their business re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd hast, to Church they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go, presently because they were most of 'em in Men's Apparel, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52840:52"/> besides, they had neither a <hi>Marshal,</hi> nor a <hi>Nye,</hi> nor a <hi>Goodwin,</hi> nor a <hi>Sterry,</hi> to preach before them; therefore they hearto'd themselves up with an Old Proverb, <hi>The better day, the better deed,</hi> believing because their debates were to be about Religion, it would be the more excusable, and indeed it was no wonder that the Women should have their Religion to choose, when so many Men are in the same Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</p>
            <p>The Dutchess of <hi>Decay'd-Vertue,</hi> the Countess of <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Glee,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess of <hi>Brickle-ware,</hi> the Baroness of <hi>In</hi> and <hi>In,</hi> the Lady <hi>Fleshly-given,</hi> the Lady <hi>Sensual,</hi> Madam <hi>Fadomless,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Rantipol,</hi> desir'd to be excus'd their attendance for that day, in regard they were altogether unacquainted with matters of Religion, and believing they could better spend their time at <hi>Lantra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loo</hi> or some other Chamber-practise, well knowing that their Consciences were not so streight-lac'd, but that they could dispence with playing at Cards a Sundaies, or any other time as opportunity offer'd it self. With these in the afternoon joyn'd the Countess of <hi>Rut-land-shire,</hi> and the Baroness of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52840:53"/>
               <hi>Giddy-Hall,</hi> having first satisfiy'd the nicety of their Morning Devotions with a Lecture out of <hi>Cassandra,</hi> and two or three short Homilies out of the Queen of <hi>Navars</hi> Novels.</p>
            <p>But in the Grand Cabal debates ran very High; and indeed it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Importance to find out what Religon was most Contentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Form of Government they had made choice of.</p>
            <p>Quo' the Lady <hi>Voluble</hi> it is not in choosing Religion, as it is in choosing a Piece of Point Lace. I would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to see all the Point Laces in both the Exchanges in half a day—but I would not promise to survey all the Religions in the World in half a year, the Jewish Religion was the first in the World—but that is not for our Turn—for that allows the Men Plurality of Wives—but we must have a Religion that will allow Plurality of Husbands; and I doubt when all's done, we must be forced to make a Religion of our own. For I have alwaies lookt upon the Form of Government to be the Body, and Religion to be the Suit. Some call it the Cloak, but I say the Suit; now if the Suit be not made fit
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52840:53"/> to the Body, the Suit will never sit well; besides that it will be uneasie and troublesome. Thus the Gown and Cassock accommodates with Maner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee, and Calvinism agrees with none but Common-wealths; but we wave both those Religions, as having utterly rejected both those Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as not being for our Turn.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Quaquerism</hi> was utterly condemn'd, because it destroy'd the Manufactures of Ribbin-weaving and Gold-lace; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it held Plaies and Romances in Abomination.

            <p>I hate a Hypocrite with my heart, quo' the Lady <hi>Nimble-Clack;</hi> I am for dealing fairly above board; they say the Anabaptists are the honestest people i' the World, they'l not take a Peny more then they ask ye.—</p>
            <p>Hang 'em, quo' Madam <hi>Tomboy,</hi> there's a Religion indeed! They never Christen their Children—they are a Niggardly Generation, that to save a little Burnt Wine and a few Boxes of Sweet-meats, destroy all the Pleasures of Female Society. They only go to a Pond and dowse one another, over Head and Ears, and so home again. Meer she Cynies not fit for Common Conversation; No, Madam, if we must choose our Religion among these sort of <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> I am clearly for your <hi>Ranters.</hi> They are a jolly sort of People indeed, they meet together Male and Female, Higgledy Piggledy,

            <p>By my troth, and I think so too, quo' the Lady <hi>Rantipol;</hi> I like a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that has some mettle in't not to sit dream, dream at Church, as it were in so many <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Sweating Tubs—and so to a Muddy Ale-house at <hi>Isling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> or a walk i' the Charter House-Garden—and then home to Repetition; What a World of Time is here lost?

            <p>Not so fast pray now, quo' the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Nimble-Clack,</hi> we have forgot the Religion of the Papishes all this while Methinks 'tis a very prety Religion; they have the featest way of Worship i' their Chappels, they Come and Go, and Go and Come—and Pray
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52840:55"/> and Whisper and Laugh, and Laugh and Whisper and Pray all at a time—Methinks 'tis such an Easie way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Heaven—while others are pent up four hours together like sheep in <hi>Smithfield</hi> Pens upon a <hi>Munday</hi> Morning, and there they must stay murdering a farts, till the man with Kerchief about his neck has <hi>said</hi> out his, <hi>say.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Cuds Life the Papishes! quo' the Countess of <hi>Whigg-land,</hi> Lord! Ladys, would you have us all Murdered in our Beds? They are all for Powder Plots and Massacres, and Rebellion; should we suffer our selves once to become <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishes,</hi> we should never be at quiet among our selves; we should have the <hi>Jesuits</hi> among Us, those Monsters of People, Saw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Oh but quo' the Lady <hi>Nimble-Clack,</hi> I could willingly be content that we might have an Order of <hi>Popes</hi> among Us; I fancy a Triple Crown would become me mightily; if ye set up the Religion of the Papishes, we may so bring it to pass that all the Ladies <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernantes's</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52840:55"/> shall be made Popes, and wear Triple Crowns to distinguish them from the inferior sort; or else we may give our selves the title of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and that's as well. I fancy we should look very Majestically in <hi>Scarlet Gowns</hi> and <hi>Red Hats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Madam,</hi> reply'd the Countess of <hi>Whigg-land</hi> addressing her self to the Lady <hi>Speaker,</hi> the Gentlewoman that spoke last, does not consider that the very Garments of the Papishes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious; they will infuse into us all their▪ evil qualities, make us covetous as they are, cruel as they; we shall be presently laying Taxes upon the Bawdy Houses, making people pay for confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their sins. And then, another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish inconvenience would follow, that should we use our selves to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Habit, it would so habituate the Women to the practise of Male Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that we should have 'em all grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Corn at the Mens Windmills, &amp; so spoil the trade of their own Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills, which would prove of very dangerous Consequence; or at least it would bring them to practise all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with one another without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Men, as the Popes and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52840:56"/> Cardinals converse and sport with their Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>amites and <hi>He-Misses</hi> without any regard to the Women.</p>
            <p>The Lady sensual inveighed bitterly against their fasting and pennances, Especially the self punishment of Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which she alleadg'd was only for Beggars and vagabo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds.</p>
            <p>These were cruel <hi>Rubbs</hi> in the way of the <hi>Papishes;</hi> but nothing more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd its advancement then that it was accus'd of being guilty of Idolatry; to which they were told the <hi>Papishes</hi> were so sottishly addicted, that they would worship an Old Mapstick, if you could but make 'em believe it to be a Piece of the Great St. <hi>Christophers</hi> Pike-staff. Thereupon with a General Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they sent the <hi>Papishes</hi> to the Devil, not allowing of any Idolatry but what was given to themselves.</p>
            <p>Quo' the Lady <hi>Voluble,</hi> why such a deal of stir about Religion? The less we have, the better—'tis that which still sets the men together by the Ears, and alwaies had done ever since there was any Religion in the World; and therefore, said she, we have but little Reason to be so fond of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—a little of that will go a great
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52840:56"/> way—we Women are not so sharp upon cutting one anothers throats—but if ye will needs set up a Religion, Ladies, as it will be very proper for outward Ornament, and shure you can never pitch upon a better Religion then that which they call the <hi>Independant,</hi> for as <hi>Anarchee</hi> permits every body to do what they please in <hi>Temporals,</hi> so <hi>Independency</hi> implys the same liberty in Spirituals; for they that depend upon <hi>Nobody Nobody,</hi> has any thing to do to contradict 'em: and I believe we should be as loath to be contradicted in Religion, as in the management of our temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Now being <hi>Independants</hi> in our Religion, what has any body to do with us? but that we may do in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion what we please as we do in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State; a Pudding is not so pat for a Fryers Mouth as an <hi>Independant</hi> Religion for Anarchee, your <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> are neither Debtors nor Creditors, they neither borrow nor lend their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but every one follows her own humor, either goes to Church or stays at home, according to her own humor, or as her cloaths pleases her, being <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant</hi> to all the World besides.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:52840:57"/>
            <p>Then again, said the Lady <hi>Voluble,</hi> she that is an <hi>Independant,</hi> has an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer ready to all impertinent Questions. Whither are you going? saies my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, what's that to you say I, I am <hi>Independant,</hi> what made ye out so late? 'tis no matter, say I, I am an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>—where have you been? I am an Independant, that is to say, no body is to question my Will or my Conscience—because I am Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant in Both. And thus, my Lady Speaker, here's the Proverb of <hi>Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> as truly verifyed as ever it was in this Earth; like form of Government, like form of Religion, as fit as Box and Box-lid.</p>
            <p>Quo' the Lady <hi>Rash,</hi> pray give me leave to speak, I have not spoke yet—and I think I shall propose a Religion without exception; my Lady Speaker, in short, I propound the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Religion; this is a Religion that admits of no Law; 'tis positively an Enemy to all Law, but is a Passionate indulger of <hi>Free-will,</hi> now what would Women have more then to be lawless, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their <hi>Free-will;</hi> and this not only allowed by the form of Government, but by the Established Religion adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the form.</p>

            <p>Madam, quo' the Lady <hi>Voluble,</hi> my Opinion is that the <hi>Antinomian</hi> is the same with the <hi>Independant;</hi> for they that are <hi>lawless</hi> are <hi>Independants,</hi> and the same are also they that enjoy their <hi>Free-will; Free-will</hi> being perfect <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,</hi> now therefore seeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test is only between <hi>Antinomian</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant,</hi> I humbly move that <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> may carry it, as being the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Denomination, and a word less subject to Scandal.</p>
            <p>Thereupon after a short debate it was resolved upon the Question, that the Religion of Independency was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion agreeing to the form of Government, intended to be establish'd being <hi>Anar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Resolv'd, that so soon as we shall have set up Anarchee, we will cast off the name of <hi>Protestants;</hi> and go by the name of <hi>Independants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Resolv'd, that under the notion of <hi>Independancy</hi> there shall be a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all sorts of Religions, that ever were, or ever will be in the World; Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neses, Bannians, Heathens, Turks, Jews, Tartars, Greeks, Romans, Lutherans, Calvinists; Papishes only excepted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Constitution of the Nation will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52840:58"/> never disgest 'em, but that the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant be still the <hi>Grande</hi> of the whole <hi>Flock,</hi> the <hi>Master Bee</hi> of the whole <hi>Swarm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Resolv'd that the Independants, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians and Thelemites be all one.</p>
            <p>These things being thus luckily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, the Grand Committee dissolv'd for the Present, and the Commoners return to their own House, where the leading Ladies resolv'd to set a hundred Gimcracks afoot; to which purpose they adjourn'd for a Week, to the end they might meet in the mean time and cabal what was fittest to be done.</p>
            <p>Being reassembled it was order'd after a very short debate, that both Houses should have a great Feast, and a <hi>Grand Gossipping</hi> together, for the better maintaining of Amity and good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Soake-pot</hi> mov'd that there might be a Clock set up i' the House, for that she knew not how the time went away—but the Lady <hi>Nimble-Clack</hi> was utterly against the Motion, saying, that it was only for Nuns and Prickers of Clouts that wrought by the day to count the Hours. Business never minds what a clock 'tis—let me talk till I'me weary (quo she) and then give over—
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52840:58"/> I love a Gold Watch, purl'd with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to hang by my side for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—but for Clocks and Clock Makers, let 'em all go to the Devil—shall I when my tongues upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap, put a pegg i' the root of my Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, because the Clock strikes▪—not I, by my feth—what a fine sight it is to see a Sun-dial upon a Church Wall, with your <hi>Cambridge Pun</hi> at the Bottom, we must—But by this you may see what silly Creatures Men are to tickle themselves with such Idle Fancies and Gimcracks—away then with your <hi>One, two, three's</hi>—and your <hi>Dye-alls</hi>—let us live, and talk and be merry, and let Time with his Sith, and his Hour-glass, go and Contemplate at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and come when we send for him—</p>
            <p>While they were thus debating, of a suddain they heard a most hideous noise in the Court before the House, as if all the City Crys had been setting up their Throats in one Compass of Ground, some with durty Forhead pieces, some with fowl Night railes, some with lac'd shoes all unript—durty Gloves, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It seems the Common Curtezans having intelligence of this <hi>Grand Sessions</hi> of the Ladies, and well knowing themselves to be so Considerable a Body of the Female Common-weal, look't upon it as an affront that deserv'd their highest Indignation, to be so neglected, as not to be thought worthy being Summon'd to a Place, where they thought they had equal Right to have their shares in Counsel.

            <p>The Ladies beholding such a Frantick Rout, and hearing such a Terrible Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Burley, sent out the Lady <hi>Rantipol,</hi> the Lady <hi>Fadamless,</hi> Madam <hi>Tomboy▪</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Betty Mackarel</hi> made 'em no Answer, but press'd on with all her train, with an intention as it was thought to have brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en open the Doors of the House, and to have made their Entry, not after the manner of foraign Embassadors, but like so many Middlesex <hi>Bumms</hi> upon a <hi>Habere Facias Possessionem.</hi> Which the forlorn hope of Ladies seeing, they sent in for the rest of their Membresses, and in the mean time bestirr'd themselves with such an Amazonian Valour, that they put the whole Body of the leud Rabble to a stand; the Ladies percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their few friends so hotly engaged, come running forth with every one a Cushion in her hand, and to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal praise be it spoken, bestow'd a most liberal Voley of Turky-work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemy, who were no less dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to return 'em their Artillery back again with the same Dexterity; This Cushion skirmish continu'd till the Flocks began to fly about their Ears, and then they came to a close fight, which was maintain'd on both sides for a time with that fury, that it would have made your heart ake, had you not been a

            <p>You say very right, said Madam <hi>Fadomless,</hi>—for now then we shall see Women free, and Nature at Liberty.

For that if a Woman had a mind to Cuckold her Husband, it was the same thing as if hate had destin'd him to that inevitable Doom. And therefore were not men a Company of <hi>Cack-thoughts,</hi> Cuckowbrained Ninny Hammers, to think to make the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets run retrograde; to turn the Motion of the Spheares: or stop the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, which they might as well do as prevent their being made Cuckolds.

            <p>I need say no more; you may be sure, she, that had such a perswading fancy that the Paedagogue by his nose was furnish'd like an Emperor, was not long before she found an Opportunity to satisfie her Curiosity.</p>

            <p>Thereupon it was mov'd that a Bill should be brought in for repealing all the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is one great Convenience more that sprouts forth and erects it self out of this Abrogation of Conjugal Laws, for thereby, quo' she, we shall remove two great sins at once out of the World and ease the Pulpits of a great Deal of Lip-labour, I mean <hi>Adultry</hi> and <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> for Adultry can never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted where no Property can be claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Nor can she be said to Commit Fornication that has her Body▪ solely at her own dispose, and keeps her M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus <hi>Cuckoldry,</hi> or <hi>Wittalry,</hi> Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Adultery were to have made their Exits all together, and a kind of <hi>Community</hi> was to have made it's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Only it being consider'd that the Baroness of <hi>Horn-fair</hi> and the head Landlady of <hi>Cuckolds Point</hi> would be considerable losers by this same lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the Entayle of their <hi>Demeaners,</hi> a private Bill was order'd to be brought in to give them plenary Satisfaction out of the Lands of that Italianiz'd Son of <hi>Despotic</hi> Tyranny that stood impeach'd for Padlocking his Wives Limbeck of Salt Water.</p>
            <p>Next day a Bill was order'd to be brought in for the Suppression of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses and Taverns, for that men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52840:69"/> hence forward not to have any thing to do about the wast, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were resolv'd to keep them under their girdles, and to preserve them from the damages of continual Wear and tear by a due observation of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and sobriety; for that was a certain Rule, that as <hi>Venus</hi> grew im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent without the Assistance of▪ <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> so men's indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too much to the Service of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> render'd them unfit for <hi>Venus</hi>'s Gambolls.</p>
            <p>Another bill was order'd to be brought in for the prevention of hard studying, and for encouragement of Idleness.</p>
            <p>As to the first, it was alleadg'd that there was nothing like hard study, to cause a dissipation of the Spirits, the wast whereof being a Total preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their conveighance to the parts of <hi>Duty Now and Anon too;</hi> hinder'd intumidation and decay'd strength of Natures incumbent to the great Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Female Expectation.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52840:69"/> his Mother <hi>Venus</hi> why he never assail'd the Muses, he answer'd, that they were so intent, one upon Star-gazing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the Reconciliation of Debtor and Creditor, another upon her <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente</hi>'s and <hi>Hexachordon</hi>'s, another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one thing, another upon another, that he no soon came nere 'em, but it presently put him into such a fit of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochandriac Melancholy to see them so hard at work, that he immediatly unbent his Bow, shut up his quiver, and put out his Flambeau, partly out of shame, partly out of fear to hurt 'em.</p>
            <p>As to the second, the Lady <hi>Lustful</hi> alleadg'd, that there was nothing so advantagious to the Female service as Idleness, <hi>Ovid</hi> being asked why <hi>Egistus</hi> was so great a Cuckold maker, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, because he was an Idle Fellow, take away Idleness out of the World, and Monsieur <hi>Cupid</hi> may go hang himself with his Bow and his Arrows, as one that would soon become <hi>Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> with the expence of daily recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his quiver; therefore the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher being ask'd what sort of insects Love Toys were, answered, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52840:70"/> of Idle minds; and another grave Monsieur, Grey-beard said, that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery was the Occupation of people not otherwise employ'd.</p>
            <p>This debate produc'd an order for the bringing in two Bills more The one for a General Massacre of all sorts of Books, Historical, Theological, Astrological, Physical, Gresham, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legetical, Romanical, Hermotical, Trismegistical, all treatises of the Arts of woing and Complementing, and more particularly for the committing of <hi>Bagnals Ballet</hi> and the <hi>Government of the Tongue</hi> to the Consumption of a Flam fit to Burn and Smother the Scandal of two such Egregious▪ Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells.</p>
            <p>That both the Universities and all Schools of Learning be supprest: there being nothing that has made men so presumptuous to Crow over Women, then the Opinion of their Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and their converse with blind needy Poets, and thredbare Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers▪ But ignorance is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Devotion; therefore as they have been hitherto learning to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let 'em now learn as long to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
